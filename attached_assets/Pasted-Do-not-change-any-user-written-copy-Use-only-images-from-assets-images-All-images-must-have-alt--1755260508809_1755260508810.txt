Do not change any user-written copy.
Use only images from /assets/images/.
All images must have alt="" and loading="lazy".

1) Essays list readability (spacing + duplicates)

Files:

assets/css/styles.css

blog.html (client render script)

scripts/fetch-substack-archive.js (build-time JSON)

A. Increase vertical space between items
Update/ensure these rules (replace existing if present):

/* assets/css/styles.css */
.essay-list { list-style: none; padding-left: 0; margin: 0; }
.essay-list li { margin-bottom: 0.75rem; } /* was 0.35rem — increase for readability */


B. De-duplicate at build step (source of truth)
In scripts/fetch-substack-archive.js, after collecting posts across offsets and before writing JSON, dedupe by canonical_url:

Create a Set keyed by each item’s link (canonical URL).

Only push the first occurrence of each link into the array.

Sort newest→oldest, then write to assets/data/farewellfiles.json.

C. Defensive de-dupe at render time (belt-and-suspenders)
In the inline script in blog.html that renders #essays-list, before appending <li> items:

Track a Set of link values.

Skip any item whose link is already seen.

D. Keep date format exactly Title – M/D/YY
(En dash U+2013, two spaces on each side; already implemented—retain.)

2) Image assignment rule: start at photo3, then ascend (no repeats)

Scope: every page that shows a decorative image except the index page.

Pages to apply (if they contain an image slot):
bio.html (bottom), now.html (bottom), blog.html (top), gypsy-jazz.html (top), lemonbird.html (top), solo.html (top), subscribe.html (top), plus any other non-index page with a page image slot.

Rule (strict):

Use files named photoN.* in /assets/images/, where N is an integer.

Start at photo3, then photo4, photo5, … assigning the next number for each subsequent page instance.

Do not repeat a photoN.* anywhere.

Accept extensions: .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .webp (use whichever exists).

If multiple extensions exist for the same photoN, pick the first found in the order above.

Do not change the index page’s image.

Keep alt="" and loading="lazy" on every <img>.

Implementation hint: build a list [photo3, photo4, …] by scanning /assets/images/ for basenames matching /^photo(\d+)$/, sort numerically, then walk the target pages in a fixed order (bio → now → blog → gypsy-jazz → lemonbird → solo → subscribe → …) and assign the next available photoN.*.

3) YouTube appears twice in the dropdown → remove duplicate

Files:

partials/header.html (and also check assets/js/inject-header.js if it programmatically injects nav)

Action:

Search for all <a> with visible text YouTube.

There should be exactly one YouTube link under Other → youtube.html.

Remove any duplicate <li> (either in the same dropdown or as a stray top-level item).

Ensure only one YouTube entry remains in the rendered nav.

4) Sanity checks

Essays list: items are visually separated (larger li margin), no duplicates render, date format Title – M/D/YY preserved.

Images: every non-index page image uses a unique photoN.*, starting at photo3 and ascending with no repeats; all images have alt="" + loading="lazy".

Nav: “YouTube” appears once under Other; links correctly to /youtube.html.
