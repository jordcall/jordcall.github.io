Global rules

Do not rewrite the user’s copy. Only make the explicit text edits listed here.

All images are decorative: set alt="" on every <img> across the site (including existing ones) and add loading="lazy" where missing.

Only use images from /assets/images/. For new/changed slots, pick the first image alphabetically (deterministic placeholder; Jordan will swap later).

Keep routes as they are unless explicitly told to remove/move.

0) Inventory reference (top-level pages we’ll touch)

Top-level html files present:
bio.html, blog.html, bylines.html, contact.html, gypsy-jazz.html, index.html, kicks.html, lemonbird.html, music.html, now.html, photos.html, podcasts.html, solo.html, subscribe.html, wall.html, writing.html
Header partial: partials/header.html
Header injector: assets/js/inject-header.js
Styles: assets/css/styles.css

1) Home page (index.html) — text fixes + list sizing

Microedits (literal find/replace, keep punctuation/quotes as in source):

Replace the sentence containing “I’m not not interested in those things” with the same sentence but with the second “not” in italics:

If the page currently uses straight quotes:

Find: I'm not not interested in those things

Replace: I'm not <em>not</em> interested in those things

If the page uses curly quotes:

Find: I’m not not interested in those things

Replace: I’m not <em>not</em> interested in those things

Replace the substring “I’m also interested in doing interesting things” with:

I’m also interested in doing interesting things myself.

Remove the KICKS line entirely (delete the whole <li> that contains):

Here, you can read about previous KICKS, my term for my obsessions du jour.

Replace the blog sentence exactly:

Find (full sentence):
Here, you can access my BLOG, though I like to think of them as essays because then in my mind I look more like this than like this.

Replace with:
Here, you can access my BLOG, The Fare Well Files, where I regularly write essays.

Make the bullet list equal in size to body text
In CSS (see §6), ensure any selector that inflates the list items on the index page (e.g., .navigation-list li, .feature-list li, or equivalent) does not set a larger font-size than body.

If you find a rule like .navigation-list li { font-size: ... }, remove the font-size or set font-size: inherit;

2) Header navigation (partials/header.html)

Relabel Blog → Essays (keep the same href /blog.html):

Find anchor that links to /blog.html with visible text “Blog”.

Change its visible text only to “Essays”.

Rename first submenu items to “Overview”:

In the Writing dropdown, the item that links to /writing.html should have visible text “Overview” (not “Writing”).

In the Music dropdown, the item that links to /music.html should have visible text “Overview” (not “Music”).

Add a primary nav item “Subscribe” linking to /subscribe.html (top level, same style as other top-level items).

Remove any “Contact” link from the nav (e.g., under Other → Contact). Delete that <li><a href="/contact.html">Contact</a></li> from the partial.

(No other copy changes.)

3) Footer simplification (all pages listed in §0)

Replace the entire <footer>…</footer> on every page with this minimal version:

<footer>
  <div class="container">
    <p>&copy; <span id="current-year"></span> Jordan Call · <a href="https://farewellfiles.substack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Substack</a></p>
  </div>
</footer>


Keep the existing assets/js/inject-header.js behavior that sets the year.

4) Remove “Write on my Wall” (guestbook) from the site

Do not expose it online. Preserve code for later:

Create /unused/ if it doesn’t exist.

Move wall.html → /unused/wall.html.

Remove any link to /wall.html anywhere (header partial already handled in §2; also remove from any page content lists if present).

5) Contact page (hide, don’t delete)

Do not expose it online. Preserve for later:

Move contact.html → /unused/contact.html.

Remove any remaining links to /contact.html (footer is gone; header handled in §2).

6) Styles — H2 and list sizing (assets/css/styles.css)

Unify H2 rhythm (single definition in assets/css/styles.css):

Ensure there’s one global h2 { … } rule.

Remove/neutralize any inline or page-specific h2 overrides in individual HTML files (<style> tags).

Keep the existing font family/size scale the project already uses; just ensure margins are consistent site-wide (e.g., margin-top and margin-bottom uniform). Do not change heading text.

Index list sizing (from §1.4): confirm that any list on the index page uses font-size: inherit; and does not appear larger than body copy.

Center the button groups on Writing and Music
In assets/css/styles.css, add or adjust the .button-group rule to ensure centered layout on all breakpoints:

.button-group {
  display: flex;
  gap: 0.75rem;          /* keep existing scale if present */
  justify-content: center;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  text-align: center;    /* safe fallback for inline-block links */
}

7) Decorative images — placements & adjustments

General: for all images site-wide, ensure alt="" and loading="lazy". If any <img> lacks alt or has descriptive alt, set it to alt="".

Insert/move specific page images:

Bio (bio.html) — after main text:
Inside <main> in the primary content container, insert after the last paragraph (but before <footer>) a block:

<figure class="page-image bottom">
  <img src="assets/images/{FIRST-ALPHABETICAL}.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy">
</figure>


Choose the first alphabetical file from /assets/images/ and use its exact filename and extension.

Now (now.html) — after main text: same block as Bio.

Blog/Essays (blog.html) — between H1 and text:
There is already a TOP IMAGE PLACEHOLDER. Replace the src with the first alphabetical image path as above and ensure alt="" and loading="lazy".

Gypsy Jazz (gypsy-jazz.html) — between H1 and text:
If a top figure exists, swap src; otherwise, insert the same top <figure class="page-image top">…</figure> block right after the <h1>.

Lemonbird (lemonbird.html) — between H1 and text: same as above.

Solo Project (solo.html) — between H1 and text: same as above.

(Do not add captions or any other text.)

8) Bylines page intro (bylines.html)

Replace the existing intro blurb with exactly this copy (no changes, no additional lines), placed in the page’s main content area where the intro paragraph currently sits:

For a while, I put effort into doing freelance writing for established publications. This was a lot of fun, but it meant that my creative time became ninety-nine parts pitching to editors for every one part writing, which didn't feel aligned with what I wanted to be doing. I haven't pitched anything in a long time, and I might return to it someday, but for now I'm happy writing my blog, where I spend zero parts pitching for every hundred parts writing thanks to my blog.
Here are the pieces that I published when I was in my pitching mode.

(Keep the existing bylines list beneath.)

9) Subscribe page (subscribe.html)

Rework the main content block to only include:

A prominent link to https://farewellfiles.substack.com/ (button or link), no extra copy beyond the URL label is required.

The exact contact line (verbatim):
“To contact me, reply to a post or DM me on Substack.”

Keep one image between the heading and text (top image) using the first alphabetical image from /assets/images/, with alt="" and loading="lazy".

(Do not add any other explanatory text.)

10) Essays list driven by Substack RSS (blog.html)

Goal: A simple vertical list of links to every Fare Well Files post. Link text should be Title (YYYY-MM-DD). No thumbnails, no arrows, no excerpts.

10a) Create a tiny build utility (no external packages)

Create scripts/fetch-substack-rss.js with Node built-ins only (https):

GET https://farewellfiles.substack.com/feed

Parse with minimal regex to extract each <item> block and then:

title (support <![CDATA[...]]> as well as plain <title>…</title>)

link

pubDate → format to YYYY-MM-DD (UTC is fine)

Save JSON to assets/data/farewellfiles.json with an array of:
{ "title": "...", "link": "...", "date": "YYYY-MM-DD" }

Run this script once now in the Replit shell after edits:
node scripts/fetch-substack-rss.js
(This generates/updates assets/data/farewellfiles.json in the repo.)

(Optional, for future automation) If a package.json exists or is added later, set "prebuild": "node scripts/fetch-substack-rss.js".

10b) Render the list on blog.html

In blog.html, in the main content area, add an empty container:

<ul id="essays-list" class="essay-list"></ul>


Add a tiny inline script (no frameworks) at the end of blog.html (before </body>), that fetches /assets/data/farewellfiles.json, sorts newest first (ISO string works lexicographically), and renders:

<li><a href="LINK" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TITLE (YYYY-MM-DD)</a></li>


If the JSON file is missing, render nothing (no fallback copy).

(No other words; just the list items.)

11) Sweep: images → alt="", loading="lazy"

In every HTML file listed in §0, ensure all <img> tags have alt="" and loading="lazy". If any have descriptive alt, replace with empty alt per user request. Do not change filenames besides the spots listed.

12) Final link hygiene

Header now contains “Essays” (→ /blog.html) and “Subscribe” (→ /subscribe.html); no “Contact”.

Ensure the removed “wall” and “contact” routes are not linked anywhere (header/footers/content).

Ensure the new simple footer appears on all pages in §0.

13) Sanity checks before handoff

Load index.html, confirm:

The two microedits are present (italicized second not; “myself” added).

The KICKS line is gone.

The “Blog…” sentence replaced exactly as given.

Bullet list now matches body size.

Load blog.html, confirm:

Top image displays (decorative).

The list of essays renders as Title (YYYY-MM-DD); links open to Substack.

Load bio.html and now.html, confirm bottom images appear (decorative).

Load gypsy-jazz.html, lemonbird.html, solo.html, confirm top images appear (decorative).

Check any page for footer: minimal copyright + Substack link.

Confirm /unused/contact.html and /unused/wall.html exist in the repo and are not routed/linked.

Notes on images

For each page needing a new/changed image, choose the first alphabetical filename in /assets/images/ (deterministic). Apply the same file to all the new slots unless you prefer to pick different firsts per page (either is fine—Jordan will replace later). All with alt="" and loading="lazy".
