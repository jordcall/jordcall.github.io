Goal: Center the Substack post embed, prevent it from being cut off in preview, and keep the embed script loaded only once.

Tasks:

Ensure single embed script

In podcasts.html, make sure there is exactly one Substack embed script on the page:

<script async id="substack-embed" src="https://substack.com/embedjs/embed.js"></script>


If there are multiple Substack embed <script> tags anywhere on the page, remove duplicates so only one remains (ideally just before </body>).

Add robust CSS for centering + no clipping

Open assets/css/styles.css and append these rules:

/* --- Substack embed: center and prevent clipping --- */
.substack-post-embed {
  display: grid;               /* centers nicely without width math */
  place-items: center;
  margin: 2rem 0;
  overflow: visible;           /* don't clip the auto-resized iframe */
}

/* Substack injects an iframe; make it responsive and not clipped */
.substack-post-embed iframe {
  display: block;
  width: min(720px, 100%);     /* sensible max width */
  max-width: 100%;
  border: 0;
  /* Fallback height in case preview sandbox blocks auto-resize */
  min-height: 360px;
}

/* If any container is hiding overflow, allow visibility in this section */
.content, .container {
  overflow: visible;
}


Important: If any existing rule sets overflow:hidden or a fixed height on .content, .container, or .substack-post-embed, remove or override it so the iframe can grow.

Add accessible fallback text (no-JS + screen readers)

In podcasts.html, ensure the anchor inside .substack-post-embed has readable text:

<div class="substack-post-embed">
  <a data-post-link href="https://www.alexkaschuta.com/p/jordan-call-traditional-values-modern">
    Listen to this episode on Substack
  </a>
</div>


Do not add any inline width/height styles to the anchor; let the script replace it.

Verification steps

Run the site in Replit. Check the embed inside the Replit preview; if height still looks short, it should still be fully visible thanks to min-height:360px.

Open the running preview in a new browser tab/window (not the Replit split-pane). Confirm the iframe auto-resizes taller (the Substack script uses postMessage; some IDE previews block this).

Confirm the embed is horizontally centered at all viewport sizes.

Do not rewrite unrelated CSS or markup. Only make the changes above.
