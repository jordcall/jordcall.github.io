Project goal (do, don’t show plans):
Implement accessible global navigation with disclosure submenus; remove the “Hi, I’m Jordan” intro box everywhere; normalize typography to a single variable font; and make the header reusable across pages via an injected partial. Then run a QA pass with keyboard, touch, and hover.

0) Repository context
This is a static site served by a tiny Python HTTP server. Keep that.

All edits must be idempotent and applied across every HTML page in the project.

1) Remove the intro box
Find the element that contains copy beginning “Hi, I’m Jordan”.

Delete the HTML block entirely on every page (do not hide).

Remove any CSS rules and JS listeners that targeted it.

After removal, ensure the first focusable element on each page is the Skip to content link.

2) Reusable header partial
Create partials/header.html containing:

A Skip to content link pointing to #main.

Brand link: “Jordan Call” → /index.html.

A hamburger button (aria-expanded, aria-controls) to toggle the nav on mobile.

A <nav aria-label="Primary" id="primary-nav"> with four top-level groups:

About → children: Bio (/bio.html), Now (/now.html), This Site (/this-site.html).

Writing → Substack (/blog.html), Bylines (/bylines.html).

Music → Gypsy Jazz (/gypsy-jazz.html), Lemonbird (/lemonbird.html), Solo Project (/solo.html).

Other → Podcasts (/podcasts.html), Photos (/photos.html), Contact (/contact.html).

3) Inject the header on every page
Add a small script (e.g., assets/js/inject-header.js) that, on DOMContentLoaded, fetches /partials/header.html and inserts it as the first child of <body>.

After injection, call an initializer (e.g., initNav()) that wires up interactions.

Include <script src="/assets/js/inject-header.js" defer></script> and <script src="/assets/js/nav.js" defer></script> before </body> on every page.

4) Disclosure-submenu navigation (accessibility requirements)
Implement behavior in assets/js/nav.js:

Structure

Each top-level group contains a button with aria-expanded="false" and aria-controls pointing to its submenu <ul hidden>.

Keyboard

Enter/Space on a top button toggles its submenu.

Arrow Down on a top button opens its submenu and focuses the first item.

Arrow Up/Down moves between submenu items.

Esc closes the current submenu and returns focus to its button.

Tab order: Skip link → brand → top buttons → submenu items (when open) → rest of page.

Mutual exclusion

Opening one submenu closes the others.

Click outside

Clicking outside the nav closes all submenus.

Mobile

The hamburger toggles the whole nav visibility. When opening, focus the first top-level button. When closing, close all submenus and return focus to the hamburger.

Desktop hover enhancement

On pointer devices ((hover: hover)), hovering a top-level group opens its submenu.

On leaving the group, close after ~180 ms unless the pointer or keyboard focus is still inside (grace period to satisfy “hoverable/persistent”).

Hover is an enhancement; click/tap/keyboard must work identically.

5) Styling & layout
Edit assets/css/styles.css (or equivalent) to:

Typography

Use one variable family site‑wide: Inter Variable for headings and text.

Load via Google Fonts for now with display=swap. Add preconnect tags.

Set a system‑UI fallback stack.

Body: weight around 450, line-height ~1.6. Headings: 700.

Implement a fluid type scale using clamp() so sizes adapt between mobile and desktop.

Skip link

Absolutely positioned off-screen; becomes visible on :focus, with clear outline and sufficient contrast.

Header

Sticky at top, light border-bottom, high z-index.

Brand left; hamburger right on mobile.

Desktop: horizontal top-level list with adequate spacing (~2rem gap).

Submenus: positioned dropdown panels with padding, rounded corners, subtle shadow. Links have generous hit targets.

Mobile breakpoint

Collapse to hamburger at ≤768px.

Inside the mobile panel, keep the same disclosure pattern; submenus stack vertically (no absolute positioning).

Focus visibility

Use a visible outline (outline or box-shadow) for links, buttons, and submenu items; ensure WCAG contrast.

6) Normalize the “BIO” line
Find the line that reads like “Here, you can get my BIO.”

Ensure it inherits the site’s default font-family and is not switching to a different face or unintended size.

If it should be paragraph text, make it a <p> and remove stray classes that change font family or weight.

7) Cross‑page wiring
Ensure every HTML page now:

Includes the two JS files (inject-header.js, nav.js).

Uses the same stylesheet with the updated typography and nav styles.

Has a top-level <main id="main">…</main> target for the Skip link.

8) QA checklist (must pass before you stop)
Keyboard‑only

Tab focuses Skip link first; Enter moves to #main.

From brand, tab to each top button; Enter/Space toggles; Arrow Down enters submenu; Esc returns to button.

Tabbing away closes submenus. Clicking outside closes submenus.

Hover behavior (desktop)

Hover opens submenu; pointer can move into submenu without closing.

Leaving the group closes it after a short delay unless focus/pointer remains inside.

Mobile

Hamburger toggles nav; focus moves appropriately; disclosures work the same as desktop.

Scrolling the page does not trap focus in the header.

Typography

Only one family is used; headings/text weights look consistent; the “BIO” line matches the intended style.

Regression

No console errors; no 404s for the new partial or scripts.

Pages still validate and render under the Python static server.

9) Deliverables
List all files you created or modified.

Summarize how you met the a11y requirements and WCAG 1.4.13 (dismissible, hoverable, persistent).

Provide a short note on how to later self‑host Inter Variable and replace the Google Fonts import.
