You broke some copy. We are going to FIX, not invent.

AUTHORITATIVE SOURCES (use in this order):
1) Replit version history: restore the exact text (“copy”) from the commit immediately BEFORE the last v2 changes.
2) If version history is unavailable, use any file named websitev1.zip or similar in the project root. Unzip to a temp folder and copy the exact text from those HTML files.
3) If neither exists, STOP and output a clear list of pages you could not restore. Do not write placeholder text.

GLOBAL RULES
- Do NOT invent or paraphrase copy. Restore the exact wording, punctuation, italics, and links from v1.
- Keep all v2 structural/CSS improvements EXCEPT where the instructions below say to revert.
- Never hide items with CSS (no nth-child display:none, no max-height clipping).
- When unsure, DO NOTHING and report.

TASKS

1) RESTORE ORIGINAL COPY (EVERY PAGE)
- For ALL HTML pages, replace body text with the exact v1 text. This includes: index.html (Welcome), writing.html, music.html, lemonbird.html, solo.html, bylines.html, bio.html, now.html, photos.html, podcasts.html, contact.html, kicks.html, wall.html, subscribe.html, gypsy-jazz.html (and any others present).
- Keep headings hierarchy and anchors, but ensure the wording matches v1.
- Keep image placeholders we added, unless they conflict with real images you find in v1; if conflict, prefer the real v1 images and delete the placeholder.

2) BYLINES: SHOW ALL + RESTORE CATEGORIES
- Bring back ALL byline entries and the same CATEGORY GROUPINGS and order used in v1 (e.g., the exact section headings and which items appear under each).
- Use the new card layout for each item, BUT group them under the v1 category headings.
- Ensure no CSS limits the number of visible items. Remove any rule that hides items (e.g., :nth-child or max-height).
- If a byline item had no thumbnail in v1, render the card without an image rather than using a placeholder.
- Keep external links, dates, and publication names exactly as v1.

3) FOOTER: REMOVE TAGLINE. USE MAIN MENU ONLY.
- Remove the “Making things that help people fare well — …” tagline and the big subscribe button.
- Footer should simply list the main menu links, same order as the top menu, no extras:
  Writing, Music, Bylines, Photos, Now, Bio, Contact, Subscribe, This Site.
- “This Site” must link to /index.html#about-site (no separate page).
- Keep © YEAR Jordan Call.

4) WRITING PAGE: COPY + BUTTONS FOR TWO SUBCATEGORIES
- Use v1 text for the Writing page.
- Below the text, add two large, clean buttons (not a “New here?” box):
  - “Substack” → link to the Substack page you used in v1 (or /subscribe.html if that’s how v1 linked).
  - “Bylines” → /bylines.html
- Style: simple solid buttons with gentle radius, readable size, and clear hover/focus. No shadows needed.
- Remove the prior “New here?” CTA box entirely.

5) MUSIC PAGE: COPY + BUTTONS FOR THREE SUBCATEGORIES
- Use v1 text for the Music page.
- Below the text, add three buttons (same style as Writing):
  - “Gypsy Jazz” → link to the v1 target page for this category (if a dedicated page exists, use it; otherwise use the page that best matched in v1, e.g., /gypsy-jazz.html or the relevant section).
  - “Lemonbird” → /lemonbird.html
  - “Solo Project” → /solo.html
- Remove “Solo guitar,” “Kicks,” “Hire me / collaborate,” and “Wall Project” buttons/links that were added in v2.

6) NAV MENU BEHAVIOR AND LOOK
- Restore the visual style so “Writing” and “Music” look like the other menu items (no oversized label with little arrow).
- Behavior: Hover opens the dropdown; Click navigates to the parent page (Writing → /writing.html, Music → /music.html).
- Accessibility: keep keyboard access—focus/arrow keys should open the submenu. Clicking the label still navigates.
- Remove the separate chevron button if it was added. Hover/focus CSS plus JS focus handling is fine.

7) LEMONBIRD PAGE
- Restore the exact v1 copy and the Spotify embed (same track/playlist/album, same iframe attributes).
- Ensure the embed is responsive: width:100%, max-width of container, and a reasonable height (use the v1 height if present).

8) SOLO PROJECT PAGE
- Restore the exact v1 copy and Spotify (or other) embed exactly as in v1, responsive as above.

9) WELCOME PAGE TYPOGRAPHY
- Make all body paragraph text on the Welcome page one consistent font size (use the v1 size). Remove any v2-specific larger paragraph sizes there.
- Keep headings sized appropriately but do not mix enlarged paragraph styles within the body.

10) JUSTIFICATION
- Keep paragraph justification IF it does not change line breaks in a way that alters the v1 copy. If justification causes awkward rivers on mobile, allow ragged-right on small screens. Do not alter the actual text content.

11) QA & CLEANUP
- Confirm every “This Site” link points to /index.html#about-site.
- Confirm Bylines: every item from v1 appears, under the same category headings, and is clickable.
- Confirm Writing and Music have only the specified buttons and no “New here?” box.
- Confirm Lemonbird and Solo pages match v1 copy and embeds.
- Confirm footer shows only the main menu links + © YEAR.
- Confirm no console errors.

AT THE END, PRINT:
- A checklist showing each task 1–11 with PASS/FAIL.
- If any page’s v1 copy was not found, list the page and STOPPED changes you avoided instead of inventing text.
