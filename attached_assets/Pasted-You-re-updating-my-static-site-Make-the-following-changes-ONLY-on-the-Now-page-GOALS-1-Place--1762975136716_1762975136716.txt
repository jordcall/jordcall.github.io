You’re updating my static site. Make the following changes ONLY on the Now page.

GOALS
1) Place the page’s “footer image” immediately after the CURRENT Now installment content (symbolic end), not at the absolute bottom.
2) Render the Archive as full text entries (no accordion/JS), each separated by a thin rule.
3) Add my 2025-07-26 installment EXACTLY as provided below.
4) Remove or disable the accordion UI and its JS on this page so there’s no “Expand” button and no broken behavior.

FILES TO EDIT
- now.html (primary)
- site/global layout or include that injects a bottom-of-page image (only if it’s auto-injected on all pages)
- CSS file (add tiny styles). Common names in this repo include: `assets/css/site.css` or `assets/css/styles.css`. Use whichever exists.

DETAILED STEPS

A) Update `now.html`
1. Find the section that contains the CURRENT Now entry (the visible, most recent one). Immediately AFTER that block, insert the page’s footer image block (whatever HTML we already use for the bottom/hero image), so the image visually ends the current entry. Add an HTML comment marker just above it:
   `<!-- CURRENT-NOW: symbolic end image -->`.

2. If the “bottom image” is currently injected at the very end of `now.html` (or via a global include in the layout), make sure it does NOT appear again at the absolute bottom of this page. Either:
   - Remove the bottom-of-page image on `now.html`, OR
   - Add a guard flag on this page so the layout/include skips injecting it (e.g., a page variable like `no_bottom_image: true` and a corresponding conditional in the layout). Use whatever mechanism the codebase already uses.

3. Remove the archive accordion controls and script refs from `now.html`. Specifically:
   - Delete any “Expand all / Collapse all” buttons or other accordion toggles.
   - Remove the `<script>` tag that loads `assets/js/now-archive.js` (or similar) from this page.
   - Remove any empty container like `#archive-list` that existed only for JS population.

4. Replace the archive area with static HTML:
   - Add a heading `Archive`.
   - Insert the following HTML for one archived installment (EXACT text preserved). Use this markup structure and classes:

Keep the EXACT punctuation, capitalization, and curly quotes shown above.

B) CSS
In the main site stylesheet (e.g., assets/css/site.css), add these styles (near other page-specific rules is fine):

css
Copy code
/* Now archive presentation */
.archive-sep { 
  border: 0; 
  border-top: 1px solid var(--border, #ddd); 
  margin: 2rem 0; 
}
.archive-entry { 
  padding-top: .5rem; 
}
.archive-entry .now-updated { 
  margin: 0 0 1rem; 
  opacity: .8; 
}
.now-item { 
  margin: 1rem 0 1.25rem; 
}
.now-item h3 { 
  margin: 0 0 .25rem; 
  font-size: 1.125rem; 
}
C) Clean up (optional but preferred)

If assets/js/now-archive.js exists only for the accordion, you may delete it and remove any unused import references. Do not break other pages—if any other page imports it, leave the file but make sure now.html does not load it.

D) Verification checklist

On /now, the current Now content displays, THEN the footer image, THEN the “Archive” heading and the July 26, 2025 installment in full text.

No “Expand/Collapse” buttons appear on this page.

No duplicate bottom-of-page image appears after the archive.

CSS renders a thin rule between entries.

HTML validates (no unclosed tags).

Make the above edits and commit.
