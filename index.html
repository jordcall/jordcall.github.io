            <div class="content">
                <p>It's a familiar story: you go to someone's website, click on "About Me," eager to learn all about them—only to find a few paltry crumbs of information, hardly enough to be worth the click. Oh, you "have words" in Vulture? You like hiking with your dog in your free time? Come on. Give me more than that! I'm trying to be friends here!</p>

                <p>So I'm going to be the change I want to see in the world and give you more than you wanted to know.</p>

                <p>My name is Jordan. I built this site basically to be an extended "About Me." Its primary goal is to help me connect with interesting and like-minded people. Its primary mechanism for doing so is cataloging and contextualizing the projects I like to devote my time to. They are varied in type, topic, and levels of completion, and none has achieved any particular virality or prominence—but I wanted to have a place where I could gather them together and contextualize them in one public portfolio nonetheless. </p>

                <p>There are a lot of reasons to make a personal website: build credibility, sell a product, establish a brand, etc. I'm not <em>not</em> interested in those things. But when I consider my motivations for this, it comes back to my lifetime of experience clicking on other people's pages. There are so many interesting people in the world doing such interesting things. I'm so curious about them! I always appreciate being afforded a little window into their world. I'm also interested in doing interesting things myself. So here's a site for the curious as I attempt to do just that.</p>
