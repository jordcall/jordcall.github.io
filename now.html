            <div class="now-item-body">
              <p>In my eternal quest to become a gypsy jazz guitar "djenius" (like Django Reinhardt), I am always looking to improve the quality and quantity of my practice. To that end, I created an app tailored to my needs where I record, track, and quantify my practice sessions and progress. This project has taken me many weeks and it's now in what I might call a "functional alpha" stage. Now I'm actively using it for my practice, and soon I'll update whatever functionality needs I find and do a UI overhaul. You can download the APK on <a href="/djenius.html">this page on my site</a>.</p>

            <div class="now-item-body">
              <p>This website is the project that keeps on giving - I'm always finding new things I want from it. Most recently, I migrated the site over from Replit to GitHub Pages, and I learned to edit it with VS Code and Codex rather than using Replit's agent. Even though it's overwhelmingly vibe coded, I'm still learning a ton about development, and sometimes deep down where no one can see, I imagine myself to be a real developer.</p>

            <div class="now-item-body">
              <p>My wife and I used to love watching TV together, but for maybe a year now we've really struggled to find anything we feel is worth the effort of even looking at a screen for an hour. One exception to this has been the Fallout series on Amazon (Vidangel-edited!). Now that she's familiar with the world and lore, I thought maybe we'd try firing up Fallout 4, which I have for PS4. We're so far really enjoying exploring the Commonwealth together - it scratches a similar itch that TV once did (excuse to snuggle on couch after a long day) but feels more interactive.</p>

            <h3 class="now-item-title">Perfect pitch training - update!</h3>
            <div class="now-item-body">
              <p>In my last entry I mentioned that I'm trying to teach my kids perfect pitch with the Clear Pitch app, and that I didn't expect to develop it myself. Well, a few weeks ago, I tested it and I can actually hear and remember some of the chroma of many of the notes!! This is a huge and unexpected development. It's still early stages but I am amazed that I am often able to identify these pitches - I once got 15/16 correct in a row. So I've redoubled my efforts and hope to improve my speed and accuracy over time. I also found a (very) recent study that challenges the idea that you can't develop it outside the critical period. Extremely exciting. (Also, my kids are killing it, and even my wife is starting to hear it - and she's barely even been around when we do the app!)</p>

            <div class="now-item-body">
              <p>For my Christmas present to my siblings this year, I recorded my various nieces and nephews singing various songs and am producing them into professional(ish) sounding tracks. (Last year I did a whole album of songs sung by own kids.) It's fun to do a little recording and mixing again. Someday I might offer this service as part of a business because I think these are such funny and fun momentos of childhood.</p>

              <p>My friend Robert of Lemonbird fame has started a business where he develops and sells plugins, which is starting to gain some traction in the production world. He's open to selling plugins that I make, so that will probably be my next coding project - I have a few ideas for plugins I'd like to try to develop and I'm planning them out in my head right now.</p>

              <p>I'm surprised I haven't mentioned this in previous installments, since it amounts to a good chunk of work every week for me - I am right now acting as the secretary for the Bishop (leader) of our ward (congregation). This is a volunteer (voluntold, actually) position and it's got me creating agendas, coordinating interviews, and attending meetings every week. It's the busiest calling I've had to date.</p>

                            <p>I took about a two-month break from creative projects. It started with feeling psychically drained by the Substack ecosystem. I spent most of that time playing what has become one of my favorite video games, Hades 2, and seeing whether I was okay or even happier setting aside my goals and just wasting my free time on a game for a while. I enjoyed the sabbatical, but I think I'm happier now that I'm writing regularly again.</p>

                            <p>Most of my instruction to my kids is either spontaneous or through passive modeling as I live my life. I think that's normal and good, but I've realized that I want to also have opportunities set aside to teach them things I think are important. So my wife and I have been implementing a practice our church encourages, "Family Night," where you have a weekly lesson and activity with your kids. We all love it!</p>

                            <p>Perfect pitch is the single thing that I wished for most as a young person. If a genie had appeared to me, I would have used my first wish on perfect pitch without hesitation. I want to help my kids acquire it if possible. The critical period for acquiring it goes to about age seven, and my daughter is five. So we've been using an app called Clear Pitch and practicing together. We're seeing inconsistent but noticeable results in both my oldest daughter and my son. I'd like to keep working on this regularly.</p>

                            <p>I decided to start a weekly meeting with my wife where we talk through the logistics of our week and divide up anything that needs to be dealt with. We've long done "companionship inventory," a practice I picked up on my mission, but that's an assessment of our relationship health rather than a logistical meeting. Both are very helpful for us.</p>
