            <h3>Build my website</h3>
            <p>I’m learning how to use AI tools to build my own website, instead of using something like Squarespace. It’s amazing how much it will do for you, and also amazing how much there is still to learn and do.</p>

            <h3>The Fare Well Files</h3>
            <p>This is my current baby. I’m about five months in and still just so energized by the process of writing essays. It takes most of my creative time, and I wish I had a lot more. I try to also be very active on Substack Notes to maintain visibility and make connections with people.</p>

            <h3>Produce consistent gypsy jazz content</h3>
            <p>After a long gestation period, I recently created a full gypsy jazz persona online, under the artist name “Jordan Michael Call.” I’m trying to post performances regularly on Instagram, as well as record/produce/release roughly one single a month. This gives me lots to practice and work on.</p>

            <h3>Teaching my daughter to swim</h3>
            <p>This has been SO fun. My five-year-old is working on earning her “yellow necklace” at the local pool, and she can do half of the requirements. We need to get her treading water next. I try to get her in a pool as much as I can.</p>

            <h3>Learning about cars with my son</h3>
            <p>My three-year-old is obsessed with cars. I’m not mechanically-minded at all, but I love the idea of learning about it someday. I want to rebuild a ’65 Mustang with him, like the one we saw at the gym parking lot the other day. So I had ChatGPT build me a college course in restoring cars. Slightly overwhelming but fascinating stuff.</p>

            <h3>Reducing screen time</h3>
            <p>I installed a widget that narcs on me for how much I’ve looked at my phone, and then I bought a smart watch so I wouldn’t be so reliant on my phone for calls and texts. I’ve cut my phone time down by several hours a day.</p>

            <h3>Make Boba Milk drinks</h3>
            <p>I bought bubbles and huge straws from Amazon and figured out how to make a brown sugar syrup. Just did my first one and it turned out incredible.</p>
